The topology file required for all atom free energy simulations for wild type beta cardiac myosins are 'prot_Protein_chain_A.itp', 'prot_Ion_chain_A.itp' and 'prot.top'.
The topologogy files (needed for all-atom free energy simulation) of adp, phosphate, and aficamten, mavacamten and omecamtiv drugs are included by the name 'adp.itp', 'phos.itp', 'afi.itp', 'mava.itp' and 'ome.itp' respectively.
A solvated energy minimised structure of drug (aficamten) bound beta cardiac myosin is 'traj1.gro'.
An index file containing drug (aficamten) bound protein is '2index.ndx'.
The all-atom coordinate file for wild type protein and the mutated protein is 'wild_aa.pdb' and 'mut_aa.pdb' respectively and their coarse-grined output result for wild type and mutated protein is 'wild-cg.out' and 'mut-cg.out' respectively.
ERIS results are in the 'ERIS-out-result.png' and the output ERIS pdb is 'ERIS-pdb-out.pdb'.
